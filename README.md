## Goal

This is a learning project in still developping field of processing seismological data.

The scope is limited to predicting seismogram data from the station MX.MOIG in Mexico.

The model trained is a stateful LSTM neural network. The prediction are on a lenght of 30 seconds.

# usage
Model sucess as been limited.

Potential use is filling gaps in live data to improve to training of more complex model in the field.

# Challenges
Somes of the challenges encountered during the project.

Creating a stable environment with the specialised libraries.

Large amount of available data can require alot of computational

Complex field in general.

# Ressources
main library comes from obspy (https://docs.obspy.org/)

Model by Tensorflow/Keras

Deployed with Streamlit
